The traffic has been transformed into the difficult structure in points of designing
and managing by the reason of increasing number of vehicles. This situation has
discovered road accidents problem, influenced public health and country economy and
done the studies on solution of the problem. Large calibrated data agglomerations have
increased by the reasons of the technological improvements and data storage with low
cost. Arising the need of accession to information from this large calibrated data
obtained the corner stone of the data mining. In this study, assignment of the most
compatible machine learning classification techniques for road accidents estimation by
data mining has been intended.There are several problems with current practices for
prevention of the accidents occurred in the localities. The database we will use is
available officially by many institutes and government websites. The data collected will
be analysed, integrated and grouped together based on different constraints using the
best suited algorithm. This estimation will be helpful to analyse and identify the flaw
and the reasons of the accidents. It will also be helpful while making roads and bridges
as a reference to avoid the same problems faced before. The predictions made will be
very much useful to plan the management of such problems. Injuries due to road
accidents are one of the most prevalent causes of death apart from health related issues.
The World Health Organization states that road traffic injuries caused an estimated 1.35
million deathsworldwide in the year 2016. That is, a person is killed every 25 seconds.
This calls for the need to analyze road accidents and the factors affecting them and come
up with a method to reduce the probability of their occurence. The analysis of road
accident severity was done by running an accident dataset through several machine
learning classification algorithms to see which model performed the best in classifying
the accidents into severity classes such as slight, severe and fatal.. It was observed that
logistic regression to perform multilabel classification gave the highest accuracy score.
It was also observed that factors such as number of vehicles, lighting conditions and
road features played a role in determining the severity of the accident.The goal of this
project is the investigate what causes not serious and serious accidents in hopes of
preventing and decreasing the number of them. The dataset consists of accidentrecords
from the UK over the course of 15+ years. I hope to show the causes of these accidents
through visualizations and create an algorithm that can predict the severity of accidents.
